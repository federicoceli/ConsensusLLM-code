class Template(ABC):
    """
    A template class for designing and running experiments with multiple agents
    and rounds.

    This abstract class defines a template for designing experiments where 
    multiple agents interact in multiple rounds. Subclasses must implement 
    various methods to customize the behavior of the experiment, including 
    generating questions, managing agents, updating experiment records, and 
    performing post-processing.

    Attributes:
        _record (dict): A dictionary for recording experiment data.
        _n_agent (int): Number of agents participating in the experiment.
        _n_round (int): Number of rounds in the experiment.
        _n_experiment (int): Number of independent experiments to run.
        _lock (threading.Lock):
          A lock for ensuring thread safety during data updates.

    Subclasses should implement the following abstract methods:
        -  _generate_question
        - _generate_agents
        - _update_record
        - _round_postprocess
        - _exp_postprocess

    Public Methods:
        - run: Run the experiment using a thread pool for concurrency.
        - save_record: Save the experiment record to a file.

    To use this template, create a subclass that defines the specific behavior
    of the experiment.
